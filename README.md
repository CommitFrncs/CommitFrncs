# Hi, I’m Francis 👋

I’m a full-stack–oriented developer with a strong front-end foundation, currently focused on deepening my JavaScript skills and building solid, real-world projects.

I’m comfortable working with HTML and CSS to create clean, responsive interfaces, and I’m actively improving how I use JavaScript to structure logic, handle state, and write maintainable code.

This profile reflects ongoing growth through consistent practice and project-based learning.
