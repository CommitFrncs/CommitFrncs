# Hi, I’m Francis 👋

I’m a front-end focused developer currently rebuilding my foundation with a structured, long-term roadmap.

Right now, my focus is on:
- Writing clean, readable HTML
- Building responsive layouts with CSS
- Strengthening core JavaScript fundamentals
- Developing real projects instead of tutorials

I’m intentionally keeping this profile minimal while I sharpen my skills and ship consistent work.
